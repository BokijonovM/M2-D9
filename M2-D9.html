    <!-- EXERCISE 1
        Create a Jumbotron section with a quick explanation / image of the website.
        Make it appear with a fade-in animation effect when the page loads.
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 2
        Use a Bootstrap Card to contain every album in the favorite list you previously created.
        Use the elements of a card bootstrap provides you with to display nicely the album informations such as: album title, artist, year, etc..
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 3
        Foreach album in the favorite list, place a badge on the top-left corner of the album with the genre of the music
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 4
        Create a new section with an album tracklist inside a Bootstrap table.
        The row colors of the table must be alternated.

        There should be a column for the track order number, one for the title and one for the track duration.
        (If you want, you can also add extra columns)
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
        Add a DELETE bootstrap button at the end of each row of the tracklist. 
        Attach the functionality to remove its row when it gets clicked. (Requires DOM manipulation)  

        ## EXTRA CSS CHALLENGE ##
        Make only one button visible at a time, for each row, when the single row gets hovered. 
        Animate it with a fade-in effect upon the user hovering and fade-out when he/she goes away from it.
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
        Add an "Add Track" button under the tracklist of the album. 
        It should have a nice shadow transition when its hovered (with the box-shadow property) 
        to look like as if the button was elevating itself.
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
        On the click of "Add Track" button, a modal should appear.
        (check in the documentation the modal + button example)
        
        The modal shall contain single input fields (avoid using a <form> to wrap the inputs) with:
        - Track number
        - Track title
        - Track duration

        The fields should be inside an Input Group and divided in 2 columns.
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
        The modal should contain 2 buttons at the bottom:
        - Add => Adds a new track in the tracklist with the data of the input fields.
        - Close => closes the modal

        https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/alerts/

    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 9
        Alert the user with a success message when the track gets added, or when a track gets deleted.
     -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
        Considering the "Add Track" functionality that you've created on ex. 8: 
         - The new list-element added to the list should appear with a fade-in effect
     -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 11
        Considering the button you've created in ex. 5 that deletes the row:
        Add a fade-out effect to the row before it gets removed, using a CSS transition effect
